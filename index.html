            <p>I started learning code when I was a student at the University of Minnesota, but I had to withdraw due to
                financial issues.
                I found programming very interesting and continued learning in my
                freetime with youtube videos and a few udemy courses. I decided to enroll into a bootcamp

            <p>Outside of coding I enjoy playing video games, fishing, hanging out with friends, and playing cards.
                Some of my favorite games are The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, CS:GO, The Witcher 3, and the card game Hand
                over Foot.
